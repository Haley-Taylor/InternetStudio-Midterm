		<h1>Statement Page</h1>
		<p class="state-p">For my visual and interaction design I wanted to capture the fun whimsical charm of the board game Candy Land. My goal was to bring the game to life, who wouldn't want to visit a magical Candy Land. I want my visitors to feel like a kid again as they are enraptured with the location. I chose a cheerful color palette consisting of light pinks and blue, my inspiration was cotton candy. These colors tie to the theme of sweets and candy, while also providing a soft, comforting feel. The serif typeface I choose for my headings is curly and mimics candy curves. It also reminds me of candy brands such as Wonka. I chose a simple rounded sans-serif to not clash with the bold serif font. This font combination provides clarity throughout the site.</p>
		<p class="state-p">I kept the layout and text placement simple and clear so users can easily navigate. My heading is large and colored specifically to grab attention. I aligned the subheading and paragraph text neatly under the headings. The font size and color slightly varies based on the specific page style. I used images such as characters, candy, and food to reinforce the overall theme and make the site feel immersive. They are placed throughout to add visual interest.</p>
		<p class="state-p">The buttons and links are very simple and styled similar to the body text elements. I added appropriate indicators so users know they are clickable. Their placement follows the text layout above it. I also added a hover effect to ensure users are aware of their actions. Overall, every design choice was intentionally chosen to create a cohesive site that reflects the essence of Candy Land.</p>
